* Plain text and Emacs
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: 01-text-editors.pdf
:END:
** Why plain text?
*** Our main goals as scientists
To make our research as reproducible and visible as possible
\pause
**** This entails:
- Sharing of code
- Sharing of data (if possible and not proprietary nor privacy sensitive)
- Sharing of output (presentation, article, website)
*** The power of plain text
- Ubiquitous
- Usually small in size
- Portable across platforms (and versions)
\pause
**** It is scriptable (both as input as output). 
Code is almost always in text format usually data is in text format as well but underlying format for output (presentation, website, tables, articles, books) can be text as well.
*** Manipulation of text
Most output is based on simple text file. There are two main final formats: HTML and PDF.  One is pageless and one is centered on the idea of the printed page.
**** This formatting requires markup-languages
- HTML and CSS
- LaTeX
- Markdown

And others (ReST, org-mode, etc)

** What is plain text?
*** Computers store numbers
- Computers store numbers in binary: 0100110 (38).
- How to represent characters ("A", "f", "%")?
\pause
**** Simple idea: numeric code for each character.  Originated at Bell labs in 1960
- ASCII: American Standard Code for Information Interchange
- 7 bits (128 symbols).
- On modern computers, stored in one byte with zero as first bit.
- For example: ``A'' = 01000001
*** ASCII table
**** 0--31 used for "unprintable" characters (BEEP! page feed, etc).
  #+ATTR_LaTeX: :width 0.9\textwidth 
  [[file:images/800px-ASCII_Code_Chart.png]]
*** All was good
Assuming you were an English speaker.
**** Solution: Extended ASCII
- We have 8 bits!  What about codes 128--255?
- IBM-PC: The "OEM" character set:  European accented characters and drawing characters.
- But everyone had a different idea of what to do with the upper codes.
*** ANSI standard
- Same as ASCII for 0-127
- But different "code pages" for upper set
**** So everything was crazy but ok
As long as you spoke a western language.

In Asia, there was a whole other mess using a mixture of one and two-byte characters.
*** Unicode
Basic idea: two bytes.  Then expanded to more (up to 3 bytes) Enough to store every character in every language.
  - Originally: \(2^{14} = 16,384\)   (2 bits reserved)
  - Currently: 110,182 code points
  - Every letter maps to a "code point" --- a platonic ideal of a character.
  - "A" is different from "a", but "A" in Times New Roman is the same as "A" in Arial
  - For example:
      :"Hello" = U+0048 U+0065 U+006C U+006C U+006F
  - Still the issue of exactly how to STORE the numbers

*** Encodings
There were multiple standards for STORING the numbers.  Original, UCS-2, uses 2  bytes.
Americans were lazy, so:
**** UTF-8
:PROPERTIES:
:BEAMER_act <+->
:END:
- Idea: use one byte for code points 0-127, and only use two for points above that.
- UTF-8 is the de facto standard encoding for unicode.
- Example, an email message header: =Content-Type: text/plain; charset="UTF-8"=

** Working with plain text
*** Why you should love plain text
:PROPERTIES:
:BEAMER_act: [<+->]
:END:
- Portability. Linux, Windows, Mac, Android, etc. *Standard*.
- Easy to use. Don't let a word processor get in you way when you just need to *write*
- Keep content separate from formatting
- Computers love plain text.  Programs are written in plain text.  Use one powerful text editing tool for everything you do.
- Version control: VC systems work best on text files (eg git)
*** What you want in a text editor
- Syntax highlighting
- Braces, parenthesis matching, automatic indenting
- Ability to work with interpreters, shells
- Spell checking

\pause
And some other things you did not know you wanted: TODOs and outlining modes, exporting to HTML or PDF, web browsing, email ...
*** Editors: free as in speech and beer
**** OS agnostic:
- *Emacs* My favorite.  Runs on everything, super powerful.
- *Vim* The "other editor"
- *atom*. By the github folks: https://atom.io/. New kid on the block
**** Windows:
- *notepad++*. Lightweight editor. Can syntax highlight R code
**** Mac
- *textmate* (textmate2 is open source)

*** Some non-free editors
- SublimeText (all platforms)
- TextWrangler and BBEdit (Mac)

** Emacs
*** Emacs
One editor to rule them all.
*** Why use Emacs? Availability
- All platforms, operating systems
- Will Always Exist (cue music)
- Open source and free
*** Why use Emacs? Best tools
- Emacs has "major modes" for most computer languages and types of files
- Powerful text management tools:
  - Compare (=diff=) documents or buffers
  - Regular expressions
  - Can deal with rectangular text (columns, tables)
- Can handle very large files
** Basics
*** Start Emacs
[[file:images/emacs-simple-start.png]]

1: Menus, 2: Toolbar, 3: Buffer, 4: Mode line (status bar), 5: Mini buffer  
*** What I see:
[[file:images/emacs-schwilk-start.png]]
*** What you'll see if you use my student starter
[[file:images/emacs-student-starter-start.png]]
*** Frames, windows and buffers
- Frame :: What we call a "window" on a modern operating system. One instance can control multiple frames. Try =File -> New Frame=
- Window :: What we would call a "panel." A subdivided part of an Emacs "frame". A way to view multiple buffers at once (eg R code and R console). Try =File -> Split Window=
- Buffer :: A name associated with the contents of a window. Can be the contents of a file, a process, an interpreter. Try =Buffers -> ...=
*** Emacs "Major Modes"
- Emacs can customize itself based on the language you are working in
- R code will look different (font colors, comments etc) from Python from Markdown.
- Emacs will guess the mode from the file extension (eg =.R=), or you can specify mode: Type Alt-x, release, then type valid mode name
*** Emacs key board commands
**** Emacs was created in the days before
- Mice
- Windowing desktop environments
- Microsoft windows or Macs existed.

\pause
**** Everything can be done from keyboard
- C :: Control key
- S :: Shift key
- M :: Meta key (usually "Alt")

*** Keyboard nomenclature
 
- "C-x g" :: hold Control while typing "x", release, then type "g"
- "M-x"  :: Hold down Alt then hit "x".  This brings you to mini-buffer to type longer commands
- "C-c C-c" :: Hold down Control while typing "c" then do that again.

*** That seems complicated
So you don't have to use those keys if you don't want to!

- The keyboard commands are featured in most Emacs tutorials. And that may scare folks away.
- I have a "cheat sheet" of commands taped on the wall next to my computer
- But you can always use the pull down menus and still do more than with any other editor.
*** Just use the menus and keys you are used to
**** Select all:
=Edit -> Select All= vs "C-x h"
\pause
**** End of buffer:
"page down" key a few times vs "M->" (Alt, Shift, greater than)
\pause
**** Moving by character:
arrow keys, "home", "end" vs "C-f", "C-b", "C-n", "C-p", "C-a", "C-e"

*** One problem:
**** You are probably used to MS or Mac cut-copy-paste
| keystroke | result |
|-----------+--------|
| C-x       | cut    |
| C-c       | copy   |
| C-v       | paste  |
| C-z       | undo   |

\pause
**** But Emacs defaults:
| keystroke | result         |
|-----------+----------------|
| C-w       | cut ("wipe")   |
| M-w       | copy           |
| C-y       | paste ("yank") |
| C-/       | undo           |

*** Easily fixed
Turn on "CUA mode", multiple ways:

- =Options -> CUA=
- "M-x cua-mode"
- Add following to emacs startup:  =(cua-mode t)=

Watch out: This overrides some basic Emacs keyboard functionality.  For example, you must turn this off for the built-in Emacs tutorial!
*** Some shortcuts you *should* use

- M-x :: execute command in minibufer --- this gives you access to every lisp function
- C-g :: Quit.  Exits a function, exits mini-buffer. Useful if you get stuck 
- C-s :: Forward search.  I use this very frequently
- M-% :: Query replace
- C-M-% :: Regular expression query replace
- M-q :: Rewrap paragraph (does right thing for code comments)
- M-; :: Comment or uncomment selected region; knows which comment character to use

*** More on =M-x=
- "M-x" gets the mini-buffer ready for a command
- Tab completeion works, so just type first few letters

\pause
***** Example: indent-region
- Highlight text ("select region")
- Type "M-x indent-region"
- And emacs even reminds you of shortcut.
** Installing
*** Installing Emacs
**** On linux
~> sudo apt-get install emacs24~
**** On Mac
- OSX: aquamacs: http://aquamacs.org/
*** Install Emacs on Windows 
- go to http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/windows/emacs/
- Download emacs by right-clicking on either emacs-xx.x-bin-i386.tar.gz or emacs-xx.x-fullbin-i386.tar.gz.
- Extract to zip file to ~C:\Program Files\emacs~
- Add shortcuts to the executable, set the $HOME environment variable(My computer ... Properties ... Advanced
- You will need to learn about environment variables so that emacs can find R, etc.
*** Customizing Emacs
- Emacs is highly customizable.  On startup it reads an initialization file (~/.emacs.d/init.el)
- I have written a set of initialization files for you: https://github.com/schwilklab/emacs-starter
*** Installing my emacs student starter
- go to https://github.com/schwilklab/emacs-starter
- read the README.md file
- Download to your .emacs.d directory (=~/.emacs.d=, or =$HOME\.emacs.d\=)
- Learn what I mean by "~" and ~$HOME~ !
*** Set up on linux
#+begin_src bash :eval no
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/schwilklab/emacs-starter.git .emacs.d
#+end_src
*** Some features and departures from defaults
Note that some things in my configuration are different from the documentation you will find online:
- Uses windows cut-copy-paste keys (*cua-mode*).
- A dark color theme ("schwilk" theme under options...customize emacs...custom themes)
- IDE for R (shift-enter starts an R session, *ESS*
- Basic support for org-mode (outline files, *org-mode*)

* Markup languages
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: 02-markup-languages.pdf
:END:
** Markup
*** What is markup?
- Even with unicode, plain text is, well, *plain*
- How do we produce pretty formatted output?
\pause
**** With markup languages
HTML (+CSS), LaTeX, Markdown, org-mode, RMarkdown, ReStructuredText.
** LaTeX
*** LaTeX
- A set of macros around Tex, a markup language invented by Donald Knuth
- A document preparation system and document markup language.
- Defacto standard in academic publishing. Formulae used in HTML pages (e.g., Wikipedia)
\pause
**** But ...
Notation is cumbersome. It is a "heavyweight" markup language. It is geared towards printed (pdf) output where pages matter (eg printed journal articles)
*** A LaTeX example
#+begin_src latex :results none :exports code
\documentclass[12pt]{article}
\begin{document}
\section*{My Paper}
I just discovered that:
\begin{equation} e=mc^2 \end{equation}

[[file:images/latex-example-emacs.png]]

*** Ready for submission
[[file:images/latex-paper-output.png]]

** Markdown
*** Still, LaTeX is cumbersome
Alternatives?
\pause
**** Markdown
- Easy to learn http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/
- Much more "lightweight" than  LaTeX
\pause
**** Purposes
- LaTeX is for paper --- PDF
- Markdown is for HTML (blogs, wikipedia) --- but sneakily uses some Latex when needed
- But with pandoc (http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/), Markdown is becoming language of choice among scientists
- You can even export from markdown to MS Word to keep a collaborator happy.

** Managing references
*** BibTeX
A reference database format

- Very versatile and very powerful (most other markup languages work with bibtex as well)
- Free managers, such as bibdesk or mendeley, are now ubiquitous. See also jabbref.  You do not need or want Endnote!

** Which markup to use?
*** Which do I use and when:
:PROPERTIES:
:BEAMER_envargs: [<+->]
:END:
- Scientific papers :: LaTeX + BibTex. Outlining in org-mode first. I'm starting to use Markdown for some papers (easy conversion to MS word for collaborators).
- Presentations :: LaTeX + Beamer when I need to control details of format, spacing, placement. Org-mode with export via LaTeX + Beamer otherwise. The source for this lecture is plain org-mode (similar to Markdown) 
- Websites :: Markdown with html and css templates (jekyll, eg http://www.schwilk.org) or org-mode export (eg http://r-research-tool.schwilk.org/)
- Documentation, notes, literate programming: org-mode or markdown

*** Pandoc
So how do we glue everything together and produce wonderful htmls and pdfs out of thin air? 

\pause
With pandoc: http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/
\pause
***** pandoc
- Pandoc can convert from :: markdown, LaTeX, HTML, DocBook, Org-mode, and ... Microsoft Word .docx
- To :: HTML formats (including HTML5 slides), via Latex to pdf, MS Word (but support somewhat limited) and OpenOffice formats, various markup formats, and much more

** Scientific workflow

* Emacs: R and reproducible research
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: 03-emacs-R.pdf
:END:
** R in Emacs
*** Work in R
- Emacs knows about R syntax
- Use shift-enter to start up R (or =M-x R=)
- Shift-enter sends one line of code to R, =C-c M-r= sends the region
#+ATTR_LaTeX: :width \textwidth 
[[file:images/ess-example.png]]
*** Moving around
- C-M-a :: ess-beginning-of-function
- C-M-e :: ess-end-of-function
*** Comments and indentation
- comment-region (C-c ;)
- M-x indent-region

Indenting should just work as you type.
*** What can I do in R?
- Run commands as normal.
- TAB Completion of functions, objects, filenames.
- At the prompt, recall history:
  - keybinding function
  - M-p (or C-up) previous input
  - M-n (or C-down) next input
  - M-r comint-previous-matching-input

And look at ESS menu
** Reproducible research
*** Literate programming and reproducible research
Combine text and code

- knitr :: http://yihui.name/knitr/. R package. Mix text and code and "knit" to output.  Can work with LaTeX (*.rnw files) and with RMarkdown (*.Rmd). Can work with emacs or with RStudio
- org-mode :: My favorite (but more emacs-specific). Can do a ton of stuff, including interspersing source code blocks, code output (including graphs) and text.

*** RMarkdown and knitr
=knitr= is an R package that can interpret .rnw files (LaTeX) or RMarkdown files (.Rmd) with R code blocks and "knit" them into LaTeX or markdown (.md) files that can be processed to html, pdf, etc (eg with pandoc)
*** RMarkdown example:
#+begin_example
RMarkdown example
=================

## some code
```{r mpg-data-plot, fig.width=4, fig.height=4}

library(ggplot2)
qplot(displ, hwy, data=mpg)

```{r}
head(mpg)

*** Text and code in org-mode
TODO
* Emacs: org-mode
** What is org-mode?
*** What is org-mode?
"Org is a mode for keeping notes, maintaining TODO lists, and doing project planning with a fast and effective plain-text system. " - [[http://orgmode.org/manual/Summary.html]]
**** org-mode is
- an outline extension with visibility cycling and structure editing
- an plain text system and table editor for taking structured notes
- a TODO list editor
- a full agenda and planner with deadlines and work scheduling
- a hypertext system, with HTML and LaTeX export
- an environment for literate programming with code blocks an manipulation of code outputs
*** org-mode outlines
Folding outlines and lists:

[[file:images/org-mode-example1.png]]
*** org-mode examples
- Outlines
- Adding tasks
- Agenda view
- Exporting to HTML or LaTeX
* Version Control
** What is version control?
*** Why use version control?
**** You already use some sort of version control
- File naming schemes (/eg/ ~my-file-July18-2013.doc~) or by copying folders around
- Simple but error-prone
- Does not help with branching, collaboration

\pause
**** A version control system (VCS) allows you to:
- revert files back to a previous state
- revert the entire project back to a previous state
- review changes made over time
- see who last modified something that might be causing a problem, who introduced an issue and when

*** git commit
A commit is a snapshot taken from the index (staging area) *not from the working directory*!
*** What exists now?

*** git diff
- =git diff= :: difference between working directory and index (staging area)
- =git diff --staged= :: difference between index and last commit 

With right options, diff can show changes between any two commits, any two files, etc. 
** Working with branches
*** Branches
A branch represents an independent line of development.

*** Show and create branches
**** Show
#+begin_src bash :results output
git branch
#+end_src

#+results:
: * master

**** Create
#+begin_example
git branch <newbranch>
#+end_example

**** Delete
#+begin_example
git branch -D <newbranch>
#+end_example


*** Using branches
[[file:images/git-branch-diag.png]]

*** Switch branches

#+begin_example
git checkout <existing-branch>
#+end_example

*** Merge
Merging is Git's way of putting a branched history back together again. 
**** Note:
This merges *into* the current branch 

#+begin_example
git merge <branch>
#+end_example
*** Fast-forward merge
#+ATTR_LATEX: :float :width 0.42\textwidth :center
[[file:images/git-ff-merge.png]]
*** Three-way merge
#+ATTR_LATEX: :float :width 0.42\textwidth :center
[[file:images/git-merge-3w.png]]
*** Example fast-foward merge

#+begin_src bash :eval no
# Start a new feature
git checkout -b new-feature master

# Edit some files
git add <file>
git commit -m "Start a feature"

# Edit some files
git add <file>
git commit -m "Finish a feature"

# Merge in the new-feature branch
git checkout master
git merge new-feature
git branch -d new-feature
#+end_src

*** Merge vs rebase
** Working with remotes
*** What is a "remote"
- a version of the repository that hosted somewhere on the internet.
- Remotes have a url (https or ssh), but the can also have names.
- It is common to have only one remote at it is named "origin"
\pause
**** Why remotes
Allow collaboration!

*** GitHub

We use GitHub for hosting, so most of of your local repos will be associated with a remote named "origin" and a url something like =git@github.com:schwilklab/CSC-sky-island-forest.git=

*** Working with remotes
When you clone from a remote, git remembers and calls that remote "origin". You can look at .git/config or, better use git commands to view:
#+begin_src bash :results output :exports both
git remote -v
#+end_src

#+results:
: origin	git@github.com:dschwilk/software-tools-course.git (fetch)
: origin	git@github.com:dschwilk/software-tools-course.git (push)

*** Adding a remote
If you need to add a remote to an existing repository:
#+begin_src bash :eval no
git remote add rem2 git@github.com:dschwilk/software-tools-course.git
#+end_src

*** Fetching and pulling
**** fetch
#+begin_src bash :eval no
git fetch origin
git fetch
#+end_src

This pulls the data to your local repository but doe not merge it.  It just means you have a local copy of the changes in the remote so that you *can* merge them.

\pause

**** pull
#+begin_src bash :eval no
git pull
#+end_src

Fetches data and then merges with your local repo.

*** git push

#+begin_example
git push <remote> <branch name>
eg: git push origin master
or just: git push
#+end_example

This works if none else has pushed changes to that remote since you last pulled. If there is an error, you will need to pull (fetch and merge) first.

*** git and GitHub

** Advanced uses

*** stage on portions of change
#+begin_src bash :eval no
git add -p
#+end_src

Interactively add changed "hunks".
* ssh and rsync
